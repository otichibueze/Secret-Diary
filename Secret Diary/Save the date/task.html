<h5 id="description">Description</h5>
<p>In second stage, add two more functionalities to your application. First, the diary should save all notes, not only the last one. Also, users may want to see when each note is created, so you need to attach the date and time when a message was added.</p>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<ul>
<li>Change the functionality of <code class="java">Save</code> button. When users clicks on it, append a new note to the top of the diary with the timestamp, which is the date and time of creation;</li>
<li>The date and time come first with the following format: <code class="java">yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss</code>. The saved text should appear in the following line;</li>
<li>Timestamp should take user timezone into account;</li>
<li>Separate each note with an empty line;</li>
</ul>
<p>Obs: The passage of time will be emulated on tests. There are several time related apis in java/kotlin/android environment, but tests time emulation won't guarantee to be compatible with all of them for this project.</p>
<p>You can use <code class="java">Clock.System.now()</code> which will be guaranteed to be compatible with tests time emulation.</p>
