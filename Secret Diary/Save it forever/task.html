<p></p><h5 id="description">Description</h5><p>We have created a nice diary so far. Users can add as many notes as they want, and remove the last one. But the application should also be able to persistently save data, and that is what you have to implement in this stage. When a text is added or removed all diary text should be saved including the date and time notations. When the user launches the application, they should see the diary exactly as before it was closed.</p><h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5><ol><li><p>Save the diary persistently into <code class="java">SharedPreferences</code> with name <code class="java">PREF_DIARY</code> and key <code class="java">KEY_DIARY_TEXT</code>. The diary should be saved after each Save and Undo action.</p></li><li><p>The content to be saved is the text on <code class="java">textView</code> as a single string with the same structure, that is, last entry saved is first entry displayed with entries separated with a blank line</p></li><li><p>When users launches the app, the saved diary should be restored.</p></li><li><p>The two buttons should work, like in the previous stage, also for the notes loaded from persistent storage.</p><p>Obs: Do not use mutation in global variables because tests do not support that.</p></li></ol><h5 id="example">Example</h5><p><img alt="Adding a note to the Secret Diary app" height="600" src="https://ucarecdn.com/7d2c04de-284e-4176-8497-31110d5dd511/" width="340"/></p>
